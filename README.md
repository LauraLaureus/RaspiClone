# RaspiClone
Cloning a image into SD for Raspberry Pi

This script contains the command to write a image of Raspberry Pi into SD. 

##Usage

Open a Terminal and move to folder where the script is. (Tip for noobs: use cd command to move from a folder to another)

Execute the script with two parameters 
1. The imagefile (It has the .img extension)
2. The name of the SD from the root. This means /dev/rdiskX where X is the number that points the SD. 

##Warning
This is too simple script because it has no user error control. It has to be done in the future.
